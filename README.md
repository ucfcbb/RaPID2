# RaPID v2

**RaPID v2** is a high-performance IBD detection tool based on the **Positional Burrows-Wheeler Transform (PBWT)**. It is designed to efficiently detect shared genomic segments in large-scale datasets and supports both high-throughput computing and stable deployment environments.

This project is the successor to the original [RaPID v1](https://github.com/ZhiGroup/RaPID), retaining its core algorithmic strengths while significantly improving performance, flexibility, and scalability.

## Modes of Operation

- **HPC Mode**  
  Optimized for high-performance computing clusters. This mode uses advanced memory-aware parallelization strategies and is ideal for large datasets and benchmarking scenarios.
 ⚠️ **Note:** HPC mode assumes access to a large machine with substantial memory (on the order of terabytes). On smaller machines, it may not perform well or could run out of memory and crash.
- **Stable Mode**  
  A lightweight, resource-efficient version suitable for general-purpose analysis or production environments with limited computational resources.

## About This Project

RaPID v2 is part of an academic research project. While it has been extensively tested and delivers strong performance in practice, users should be aware that the software is still under active development and may contain bugs or incomplete features. Feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Compilation & Usage

Instructions for building and running RaPID v2 will be provided soon.
